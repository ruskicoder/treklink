The PCB mainboard acts as the central hub for the TrekLink v2.0 handheld off-grid communicator. It must perform the following core functions:
- **Data Processing:** Run Meshtastic firmware on the ESP32-S3 microcontroller to handle mesh routing, device settings, and user interaction.
- **LoRa Communication:** Transmit and receive packets in the 433 MHz band via the SPI-controlled E22-400M22S module.
- **GNSS Position Tracking:** Capture location coordinates (GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo) concurrently via the NEO-M9N module.
- **Motion & Compass Sensing:** Capture 9-axis movement and magnetic heading (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) via the ICM-20948 IMU.
- **Power Management:** Provide seamless system power transitions between USB input and battery via the BQ24074 charger, regulate a stable 3.3V system rail via the TPS63802 buck-boost converter, and protect the battery cells via the DW01A + FS8205A protector circuit.
- **Soft-Latch Power Control:** Provide a latching power switch using a momentary button and the TPS63802 Enable (EN) pin.
- **Alerts & Haptics:** Drive audio alerts via a passive buzzer (PWM) and haptic feedback via an ERM vibration motor.

### 1.2 Input/Output Interfaces
To minimize physical stress on the board inside the enclosure, all primary user-facing interfaces and ports are mounted off-board and wired back to the PCB:

- **USB Interface:** Native USB 2.0 Full-Speed (12 Mbps) interface routed directly from ESP32-S3 GPIO 19 (D−) and GPIO 20 (D+) to the USB-C breakout pads. No external USB-to-UART bridge IC is used.

### 2.2 Signal Integrity & Impedance Control
- **RF Path (GPS):**
  - The RF trace from NEO-M9N RF_IN pad to the GPS U.FL receptacle must be routed as a **50Ω coplanar waveguide or microstrip** transmission line.
  - Layer 2 must be a solid, unbroken ground plane directly beneath this RF trace.
  - Guard shield stitching vias must be placed along the RF path to prevent noise coupling.
  - Curvy/rounded trace styling is **strictly prohibited** on RF traces.
  - *Note:* LoRa RF routing is entirely contained within the E22-400M22S module; no RF traces for LoRa are needed on the main PCB.
- **USB Data Bus:**
  - Route USB D+/D− traces as a **90Ω differential pair**.
  - Match the length of D+ and D− traces to within 0.15 mm. Keep traces as short as possible.
- **High-Speed SPI Bus (LoRa):**
  - Route SPI lines (SCK, MOSI, MISO, CS) to match length and minimize crosstalk. Max trace length ≤ 30 mm.
- **I2C Bus (OLED & IMU):**
  - Connect 4.7kΩ pull-up resistors to 3.3V on SDA (GPIO 5) and SCL (GPIO 6). Max bus length ~100 mm.
- **Low-Speed Routing (Vintage Curvy Traces):**
  - The designer may optionally use **curvy/rounded trace routing** ("vintage organic styling") for low-speed lines (I2C, UART, button lines, status LED) and power traces.
  - Include teardrops on all low-speed pad-to-trace and via-to-trace connections to match the vintage look.
