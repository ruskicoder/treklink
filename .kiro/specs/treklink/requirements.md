# TrekLink MVP Requirements Specification

> **Project Code:** EXE101-G1-TREKLINK  
> **Version:** 1.3 (MVP Release - Consolidated SSOT)  
> **Date:** February 2, 2026  
> **Status:** APPROVED FOR DEVELOPMENT

## Introduction

TrekLink is an off-grid, decentralized communication device designed for hikers, survivalists, and rescue teams operating in "Dead Zones" (areas with no cellular coverage). It utilizes LoRa technology at 433MHz to create a self-healing mesh network for reliable text messaging, GPS tracking, and automated SOS alerting without reliance on external infrastructure.

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) focuses on a standalone hardware unit using pre-soldered modules. It prioritizes reliable 433MHz LoRa communication, proprietary managed flooding mesh protocols with Forward Error Correction (FEC), and essential survival UI. The device incorporates advanced features including Pseudo-Random Frequency Hopping (PRFH) for anti-jamming, AES-128-GCM encryption for security, and a Power Gated Architecture for extended battery life (72+ hours under standard use). Bluetooth and Wi-Fi AP features are architecturally prepared but disabled in this version.

This document serves as the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for development, engineering, and testing. It adheres to the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format to ensure clarity, testability, and lack of ambiguity.
